# Data Structures and Algorithms

A collection of common data structures and algorithms implemented in Python.

## Data Structures

- **Graph** - Graph representation and operations
- **Heap** - Min/Max heap implementation
- **Linked List** - Singly and doubly linked lists
- **Queue** - Queue data structure
- **Stack** - Stack data structure
- **Tree** - Binary trees and Binary Search Trees
- **Trie** - Prefix tree implementation

## Algorithms

### Graph Algorithms
- Bellman-Ford
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Floyd-Warshall
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Prim's Algorithm

### Other Algorithms
- Heap Sort
- Linked List Operations
- Queue Operations
- Stack Operations
- BST Operations
- Tree Traversals

## Usage

Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in its own Python file for easy reference and learning.
